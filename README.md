 Project Title: Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study: Converting Casual Riders into Annual Members

1. Project Overview
This case study was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone. The objective was to analyze Cyclisticâ€™s bike-sharing usage data and recommend strategies to convert casual riders into annual members. I used RStudio to clean, analyze, and visualize over 350,000 rows of historical trip data.

2. Business Problem
Cyclisticâ€™s director of marketing wants to increase the number of annual members, which are more profitable. To support a targeted marketing campaign, I was assigned to investigate how casual riders and annual members differ in their bike usage behavior.

3. Tools & Skills Used
Tools: RStudio, ggplot2, Excel, Canva
Skills: Data wrangling, data cleaning, aggregation, visualization, storytelling
