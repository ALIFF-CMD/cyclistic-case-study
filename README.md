 Project Title: Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study: Converting Casual Riders into Annual Members

1. Project Overview
This case study was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone. The objective was to analyze Cyclistic’s bike-sharing usage data and recommend strategies to convert casual riders into annual members. I used RStudio to clean, analyze, and visualize over 350,000 rows of historical trip data.

2. Business Problem
Cyclistic’s director of marketing wants to increase the number of annual members, which are more profitable. To support a targeted marketing campaign, I was assigned to investigate how casual riders and annual members differ in their bike usage behavior.

3. Tools & Skills Used
Tools: RStudio, ggplot2, Excel, Canva
Skills: Data wrangling, data cleaning, aggregation, visualization, storytelling
