💼 Project Title: Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study: Converting Casual Riders into Annual Members

📍 1. Project Overview
This case study was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone. The objective was to analyze Cyclistic’s bike-sharing usage data and recommend strategies to convert casual riders into annual members. I used RStudio to clean, analyze, and visualize over 350,000 rows of historical trip data.

🧠 2. Business Problem
Cyclistic’s director of marketing wants to increase the number of annual members, which are more profitable. To support a targeted marketing campaign, I was assigned to investigate how casual riders and annual members differ in their bike usage behavior.

📊 3. Tools & Skills Used
Tools: RStudio, ggplot2, Excel, Canva
Skills: Data wrangling, data cleaning, aggregation, visualization, storytelling

🧹 4. Data Cleaning Summary
I cleaned and transformed two datasets (Divvy Q1 2019 & Q1 2020). This involved:

• Removing missing and invalid entries
• Creating new variables: ride_length, day_of_week, hour
• Standardizing user types
• Filtering rides with negative or unrealistic durations

📈 5. Key Insights
Include bullet points or visuals:

Casual riders take longer trips on weekends
Members ride more during weekdays and commute hours
Ride length and frequency patterns differ significantly

✅ 6. Recommendations
• Promote memberships during weekend casual rides
• Offer limited-time upgrade promos for frequent casual riders
• Target specific locations and times with personalized ads
