This case study was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone. The objective was to analyze Cyclistic’s bike-sharing usage data and recommend strategies to convert casual riders into annual members. I used RStudio to clean, analyze, and visualize over 350,000 rows of historical trip data.
